# 📺 Netflix Homepage Clone

Welcome to the **Netflix Homepage Clone** project! 🎉

This project is an improved version of a previous course assignment where I recreated the Netflix homepage. I've revisited and enhanced the original project by refining the design, optimizing the code, and incorporating new features.
. The aim was to practice front-end development skills by building a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Modern Technologies**: Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4.
- **Interactive Elements**: Basic interactivity is added using JavaScript, enhancing user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Styling the webpage, including Flexbox and Grid for layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic behavior to the webpage.
- **Bootstrap 4**: Utilized for responsive design and prebuilt components.
- **Popping.js**: Added for creating smooth and engaging animations.
